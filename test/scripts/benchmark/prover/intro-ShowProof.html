<h2>Introduction</h2>

The following table shows benchmarking results of various tests for the available prover engines in GeoGebra
for the <b>ShowProof</b> command:

<ul>
<li>Column "Engine 2" refers to <a href="http://ggb1.idm.jku.at/~kovzol/papers/Botana-Kovacs-Weitzhofer-20120326.pdf">the Groebner basis method
via SingularWS (also known as Botana's method)</a> programmed by Kovacs.
<li>Column "Engine 2, Giac" refers to <a href="http://ggb1.idm.jku.at/~kovzol/talks/ricam3/Parisse-Kovacs.pdf">the
Groebner basis method via the Giac computer algebra tool</a> (instead of SingularWS) programmed by Parisse and Kovacs.
</ul>

Explanation of the used colors:

<ul>
<li>Green means that the test returns a correct yes/no answer. Intensity of green
means speed (the lighter the slower). Numbers are in milliseconds.
<li>Pink means that GeoGebra returns the wrong answer.
<li>Yellow means the output is not conclusive, thus using this method
GeoGebra shows "undefined", i.e. there is no error here.
<li>The Result column provides some extra information about the result, such as
    "f" when the statement was false on purpose, or the polynomial degree of
    difficulty when the computation finishes. In addition: "top" means
    that the statement is true on parts and currently no proof can be showed,
    "uru" means unsuccessful run with unknown result, "tu" means that the true algebraic
    result should geometrically be interpreted as unknown, "niu" means that some
    required steps are not implemented, "ngtu" means that the statement is not
    generally true and no further information could be found, "to" means timeout,
    "tto" means a true statement with timeout when computing the presentable proof,
    "rg" means that the statement requires real geometry for further investigation,
    "npe" means that a Null Pointer Exception was not caught (this refers to some
    internal bug in GeoGebra).
</ul>

<p>The Speed column shows the timing in milliseconds.</p>
